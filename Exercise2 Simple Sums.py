#Exercise 2: Simple Sums

a = 8  #Declaring a variable "a" and assigning the value 8 to it.
b = 10  ##Declaring a variable "b" and assigning the value 10 to it.

sum = (a+b) #Declaring a third variable that stores the sum of first variables.

print("The value of the sum a and b is", sum) #prints the sum of the first and second variable.
